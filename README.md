# $HERPES - A viral token

Version: 2.0

## Development notes

In order to test the Solidity files on the BSC testnet using Truffle, users
will need to create a `.secret` file in the parent directory of their clone of
this repository containing the 12-word security recovery phrase of the MetaMask
wallet they wish to use to connect to the testnet. The `.secret` file is
omitted from commits to the repository with the `.gitignore` file for security
reasons.
